## Description
This application is a portfolio for myself to show future employers. Though this is not a completed portfolio and is more a mock up.


## Motivation for Development
The motivation for development was to show future employers that I can do this kind of work and complete these projects. I want to showcase my work in a well done application that reflects me.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Technologies Used: 
This project uses the technologies of HTML and CSS


## Challenges 
Flex. Flex was a huge challenge for me. I had a really had time with flex but I played the frog game some and it helped. 


## Successes
Figuring out flex. Flex was such a challenge that figuring it out belongs in the successes


## Directions for Future Development
Put in my actual projects not fake ones. 
Also make it more user friendly maybe a drop down box to see projects 
Also add projects I have done myself that are not only ones done in school

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
